This application showcases 3 seperate products at once for voting.  It goes for 25 rounds ensuring to not implicate any bias. The photos do not show up duplicated in the same turn, or in the following turn.  After all 25 rounds, the app showcases how many votes were collected, and how many times each product was shown to the voter in a bar graph.
